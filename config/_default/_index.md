I am a PhD student at the [université de Mons](https://web.umons.ac.be/fr/) and at the [université de Namur](https://www.unamur.be/) (Belgium). After studying physics, I turned to philosophy and started a thesis in philosophy of science. My research focuses on the philosophy of physics, the epistemology of models and the concept of fiction in the context of the debate between scientific realism and anti-realism.
