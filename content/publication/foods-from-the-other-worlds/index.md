publication: "Alimentopia - Utopian Foodways : critical Essays"
abstract: Considering  the  States  and  Empires  of  the  Moon  and  the  Sun  as  a  utopia  cannot  be  taken  for  granted.
  Indeed, many of the scenes and societies visited by Dyrcona on the Moon and
  the Sun look like dystopias at first sight. In any case, the adventure
  regularly turns out badly for the hero, who is forced to escape or go
  elsewhere to see if other places might be more favourable to him. In addition,
  one can often get the impression that expeditions serve more to criticise
  Cyrano de Bergerac’s society than to describe an ideal society. Moreover, the
  role played by the science of his time and the author’s fanciful inventions
  could suggest, rather, that we are perhaps looking at one of the first science
  fiction novels. So, the first question is to ask ourselves what kind of novel
  this strange unfinished novel is, which shares with other novelistic genres
  the description of different societies. To this end, it is necessary, first of
  all, to clarify these concepts.
