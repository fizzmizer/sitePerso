abstract: >
  Einstein gravity supplemented by a scalar field nonminimally coupled to a
  Gauss–Bonnet term provides an example of model of scalar-tensor gravity where
  hairy black holes do exist. We consider the classical equations within a
  metric endowed with a NUT-charge and obtain a two-parameter family of
  nutty-hairy black holes. The pattern of these solutions in the exterior and
  the interior of their horizon is studied in some details. The influence of
  both — the hairs and the NUT-charge — on the lightlike and timelike geodesics
  is emphasized.
