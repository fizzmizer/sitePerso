abstract: >
  In recent years, the question of scientific representation has attracted the
  attention of many philosophers and has been much discussed (see for example
  the collection of articles edited by Mauricio Su√°rez: Fictions in science:
  philosophical essays on modeling and idealization, Routledge, 2009). Many
  conceptions oppose each other on different points of analysis, but the
  problematic is generally structured around the notion of model and its
  relation with scientific theories. The central question is therefore: what
  makes a scientific model represent the system under study?


  Among the conceptions defended, one is based on a similarity between model-based reasoning and works of fiction. This fictional view of models bases its analysis on Walton's concept of make-believe. According to its advocates, the scientist's attitude when using a model to represent a physical system is the same as when we are faced with a work of fiction: we pretend to believe what is told to us, even if we know that approximations, idealisations or fictions are integrated into the model. This conception therefore raises questions both about the explanatory capacity of models and about their ontological interpretation.


  In this presentation, I will first show how the fictional conception of models allows us to answer some general problems of scientific representation. In particular, I will focus on the importance of taking into account the possibility of misrepresentation in an account of scientific representation and on the problems that this poses to purely structural conceptions of models.


  Secondly, I will address the case of realism. If scientific realism states that science aims at truth, the fictional account I defend seems at first sight to promote anti-realism. I will show that this is not the case and that a realistic conception of scientific theories can accommodate the problem of misrepresentation.
