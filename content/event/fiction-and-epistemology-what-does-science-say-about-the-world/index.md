title: "Fiction and epistemology: what does science say about the world?"
abstract: "There are several ways of looking at fiction in relation to science. On the one hand, we can look at the usual concepts used in science and epistemology to show that they contain elements that can be described as fiction. On the other hand, it is also possible to take the opposite path and build a system of thought in which fiction has a founding role, which we have seen with the development of a fictionalist approach to mathematics. In this intervention, I will consider fiction not as an object of study whose functioning must be understood, but on the contrary as a tool for questioning science and better understanding its mechanisms. This presentation will take place in two stages: first, I will address the question of realism by showing that it is compatible with the consideration of fictions; second, I will address the problems of interpretation of scientific theories, particularly in quantum mechanics, to identify what fiction can bring to these questions. The philosophical concept of fiction proved particularly interesting when it came to revealing that entities that were considered real were in fact only mental constructs. This is obviously the case in the fictionalist approach to mathematics, but the same approach is found in other areas of research in philosophy, in ethics, for example, or even in law, ethnology, literature or psychology. When it comes to experimental sciences, the main problem that arises is the agreement between theoretical predictions (whether mathematical or not) and measurement results. Indeed, considering fiction in science requires us to question the nature of what the theories seem to describe and how such a description can be done: how can we really know reality (if such a thing is definable in the fictional context) if we only have fiction at our disposal, how to explain the apparent agreement between fictional constructions on the one hand and measurement results on the other hand, how to establish a link between the two?

In this speech, I would like to address this issue by showing that it is possible to combine fiction with a realistic vision of science. Indeed, one could at first sight consider that fiction has, by definition, nothing to do with the scientific will to describe reality, and that taking fiction into account would irreparably lead to the conclusion that science is only one belief among others, neither truer nor better justified. However, if we consider even the simplest of scientific theories, it is necessary to include elements that seem fictional: a formal system only explains the world if it can be correctly interpreted, that is, if it is equipped with hypotheses that make it meaningful. A theory therefore does not directly describe reality, and it is in this sense that it is a fictional tool. And in this context, if we consider two theories explaining the world, i. e. two rival fictions, it is necessary to be able to compare them. If we consider statements specific to a fiction, we see that they must be arranged according to rules that are dictated by the fiction itself. For example, once it is accepted that a story takes place in a particular universe governed by a particular set of rules, this cannot change. This is the whole point of what is called the voluntary suspension of disbelief, which is the process by which the reader accepts the rule of the game dictated by the author. This suspension can be broken under certain conditions, thus making the reader leave the story, which shows the importance for an author to propose a coherent and, if not realistic, at least likely universe. In science, if we adopt the realistic approach, it is necessary to make the fictions we build on the world compatible with reality, which requires being able to establish a link between the two and to find a demarcation criterion between acceptable and unacceptable fictions. Another common point between artistic and scientific fictions seems to be the possibility of discovering, once the rules of the game have been established, true and yet unknown statements within the fiction. If the object of such research is the very purpose of science, I will show that this aspect of the problem seen more generally from the perspective of fiction offers new avenues for reflection to understand how theories can actually explain the world. Jean-Pierre Cléro has shown very well that the complex articulation between fiction, reality and truth implies that the evolution of science and the refinement of scientific theories cannot be conceived as a progression towards a state that can be defined. This is the whole point raised by Roman Frigg and Ronald Giere when they show that while a scientific model of reality can be considered a work of fiction, the link between the model and what it represents remains difficult to define since the object represented continues to escape us. I will show from there how it is possible to find an answer and how one can still look for a logical link between fictional proposals and proposals outside this fiction. I will show more precisely how this approach is compatible with the realistic position in philosophy of science and more particularly in physics. To do this, I will focus on considerations related to the theory of quantum mechanics, which is a framework where these questions are particularly exacerbated and where examples of researching a link between formal theories and the interpretation of measurement results are particularly interesting. If time permits, I will also discuss some basic category theory to show that this mathematical theory, which has proved particularly useful for philosophers, may provide a privileged framework for dealing with issues related to fiction. Indeed, the purpose of the categorial approach is to look for links between different isolated systems of statements (called categories) and if we want to be able to compare, link or combine different fictions, it seems that this tool is perfectly suited to this philosophical research."
